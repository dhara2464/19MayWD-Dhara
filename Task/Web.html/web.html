    <h2>History of gujrat collage</h2>
    <p><b>Logo Description</b></p>
    <blockquote><b>The crest approved by the Government is in red and gold which form the college colors. The shield is one of the oldest and plainest types. There is crown in the chief which is one of the honorable ordinaries in heraldry. Under the gold chevron which is a simple decoration there is the head of a sambur distinctive of Gujarat. The motto is “Swift to Learn”
        -Gujarat College Magazine Serial 32 (September 1931).</b></blockquote>
        <p>The present form of the crest is the result of much labor and a long drown out correspondence. The shield which serves as the background is one of the oldest and simplest in heraldry. The crest is done in prominent colors, red and gold which are the proper college colors. Crown in the gold chief at the top of the shield indicates that the college is a Government institution. The crown symbolizing colonial rule was replaced post- independence, by a lighted lamp that signifies knowledge. The chevron in the gold is an ancient heraldic decoration and stands here for the imposing front of the main college building with its gabled roof. It may well be appreciated with the rising glory of the college. The sambur whose head is inscribed under chevron is distinctive of Gujarat and is known for its speed and agility. It is therefore, in keeping with the motto of the College, ‘Swift to Learn’. The crest bears the seal of Government approval.
            The Gujarat College crest will be synonymous with the highest achievement, both academic honors and sports.</p>
